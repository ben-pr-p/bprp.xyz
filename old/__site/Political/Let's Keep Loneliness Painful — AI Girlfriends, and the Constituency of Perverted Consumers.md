Perverted in the perverse sense. We are all perverts - we want things that are bad for us. We are all the AI boyfriends. 

Anger at exploitation can only come after the pain it hid is embraced. 

For the first time in a while, I was actually mouth-open gasping when catching up on the news with Replika, an "AI Chatbot" company. 

As a young-ish man on the internet, [I had gotten some of the ads from the company](https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/113wc5x/lets_gather_all_sexual_ads_luka_ever_used_to/), and understood generally what was going on, but diving deeper in to the saga revealed some 

In general, the product simulates conversation with a fine-tuned open source large language model. The speculation is that they use either GPT-J or GPT-NeoX, although I'm sure they have upgraded since. 

The model users start out with is probably some version of these fine tuned for generally affectionate and friendly conversation. The app presents one long conversation history, which, based on user reports, they seem to use a rolling context window on.

In addition to keeping some recent history in the context window for generating the next message, user reports indicate that the company fine tunes the model on your conversation based on user feedback. Although this won't be so effective at getting the model to remember specific facts about you, it will adjust the models tone and topics it discusses to match your preferences.

With the general description of the product underway, here's a brief timeline of events in 2023.

When we start to flesh out the political undertones of this phenomena, we immediately run into a bunch of tension. I think all of the following are true:
- These users are being exploited 

In fact, I'd suggest that this follows a general pattern common with consumer technology in our economic system:
- Technology X is inherently bad and shouldn't exist
- The way X is deployed by market leader A is super extra bad
- Consumer demand for X is unfortunately real and durable
- Eliminating consumer demand for X would require pro-social investment beyond the current political imagination

Furthermore, the most exploited victim at the center of this is simultaneously the hardest to organize into a movement for pro-social investment, since they are marginalized, disfunctional, likely misogynistic, and potentially not aligned - they want porn.

These aren't the people you want on your side. Not because they are not valuable and don't deserve nice things, but because they are struggling in ways that are disfunctional for them. Their disfavorable and undernourishing external environment has metastatized as an internal affliction.

This, of course, is also part of a train of a more general problem: social isolation and opression does not always generate class conciousness 

Despite social media being a socially widespread recognized harm among its users, it has not proved possible to generate a political constituency based on it, likely because itâ€™s something people see they are doing to themselves. Engineering to eliminate choice does not remove the experience of having chosen. 

One reason why, for me, alcohol is a safer drug than many others. Hangovers keep you honest. 


Let the experience of being painfully lonely change you, and how you live your life. Have anger at everything which prevented you from moving through these emotions, and develop hope that others can come with you.
