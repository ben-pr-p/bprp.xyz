On this page there are a few projects I've been thinking about doing and am in a state of having "half-started". 

I'm looking for some friendly, low-commitment collaborators to explore these with me. None of them are particularly active at any moment in time, but I'm ready to work on any if the time and right collaboration strikes.

If you're interested in working with me on any of these, please email me at ben.paul.ryan.packer@gmail.com.

### Current Focus
- [[Structured Note Taking for Organizers]]

### Other Ideas
- [[Better Local Voice Document Editing]]
- [[How to Blow Up Enough Pipelines]]
- [[Cooking with Graphs (Fine Tuning an LLM + Graph Semantic Analysis)]]
- [[An Ahead of Time Database]]
