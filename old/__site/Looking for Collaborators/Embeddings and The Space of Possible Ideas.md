I have often enjoyed thinking about typically non-mathematical concepts in n-dimensional space. Doing so is relatively simple and does not actually involve any math. All you need to do is create a little typology of the samples you already have, and then prod your brain for the blanks.

For example, let's consider "the space of possible opinions about hamburgers". 

We start off with some sample of known opinions:
- I like hamburgers. They are tasty, and fun to cook outside with friends.
- I don't like hamburgers because I'm vegetarian, and I think eating meat is wrong. If you want to cook outside, you can just grill veggies.

This seams pretty basic, but can be a bit revealing if you typologize and decompose it a bit. The first statement is pro-hamburger, believes hamburgers are tasty, and is pro-grilling. The second is anti-hamburer, anti-meat consumption, and pro-grilling.

We can chart the first opinion as:

| Question | Pro | Anti |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hamburgers good | X |  |
| Hamburgers tasty | X |  |
| Grilling is fun | X |  |
| Meat is immoral |  | X |
And the second as:

| Question | Pro | Anti |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hamburgers good |  | X |
| Hamburgers tasty |  |  |
| Grilling is fun | X |  |
| Meat is immoral | X |  |

Ok, pretty basic stuff. The fun can start when you begin by putting things on the chart, and then trying to think of the opinion that fits the vector.


| Question | Pro | Anti |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hamburgers good |  | X |
| Hamburgers tasty | X |  |
| Grilling is fun |  | X |
| Meat is immoral |  | X |




In this case, you actually know the dimensions that you want to reduce it to (specified by the user) so it's not standard PCA.
