My name is Ben Packer and I am a Brooklyn based software engineer and socialist passionate about the upcoming PostgreSQL release and surviving the 21st century. 

In 2019, I was a co-founder of [[Things I've Tried|Rewired Coop]], a technology coop building software for organizers with roots in the Bernie 2020 campaign and the  Democratic Socialist left. 

In 2024, I began my current role working on the technology for communications and organizing systems for the United Auto Workers.

## Writing

I originally made this website because I wanted a minimalist website with the Latex font and the Solarized Light color theme, and I also thought I might write some things. Some things I have wanted to write include:

* _An Anti-Cypherpunk Manifesto: It Matters to Me that You Know that I am Not a Dog_
* _Social Movements, Messianism, and the Mathematics of Phase Changes_

However, at the moment of writing I am still much better at coming up with titles than the posts themselves. If that changes, you'll see those posts below!

## Where to find me online

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bean_pooker)
* [Github](https://github.com/ben-pr-p)
* This website

## Contact

You can email me at ben.paul.ryan.packer@gmail.com. I am not important, famous, or terribly busy, and I do a good job at unsubscribing to things, so receiving an email is quite exciting!

You _should_ email me if:
- [[__site/Looking for Collaborators/Index|Collaborating on any of my side projects interests you]]
* You want to go to a Ninja Gym in Brooklyn and play around in the ball pits and stuff.
* You would like to co-organize a group industrial tourism trip. We can visit all the types of power plants, mines, small & large farms/fisheries, water and waste treatment, recycling & trash, data centers, ports, logging, etc. It would be a lot of planning but I think a good time!
* You are about to enter the labor market as a software engineer and want to ask what else I might know that you could do other than traditional tech roles. 

## Billie

I have a lab/pitt+ mutt named Billie. I usually am not too interested in photos of other people's dogs, but you can find photos of her [[Billie|here]].
