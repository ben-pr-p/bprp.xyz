>[!error] Not Available
> In March of 2024, I began a full time role at the United Auto Workers. If you have need for any of these services, you can still email me and I'll help you find someone.

This page describes the kinds of working relationships I seek and my availability for new ones.

You can email me at ben.paul.ryan.packer@gmail.com.

### Technical Contracting Work

>[!error] No availability

I have significant experience in production with high-write and high-read Postgres, and can quickly debug slow queries and give good advice on schema design and architecture. I enjoy writing Elixir and Typescript the most.

I have also recently done exploration and development with DuckDB, Delta Lake, and the larger Arrow ecosystem.

###  Organizing Data Implementation Consulting

>[!error] No availability

I have a good understanding of the way an organizing project data systems can support or hinder growth and accomplish goals, familiarity with most tools in the space, and can balance toil with complexity and maintainability. This isn't a paid thing!

### Hanging Out on a Side Project

>[!info] Could make some time :) 

I have a few [[__site/Looking for Collaborators/Index|side projects that I'm looking for collaborators on]]. We should work together on them!
