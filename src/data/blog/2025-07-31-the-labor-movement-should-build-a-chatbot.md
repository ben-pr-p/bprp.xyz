Preface:

> Before articulating what should be built and why, I just want to explain that I also agree with you that this is dumb, and like you, I also hate it.
> 
> That being said, we live in a world of unfortunate truths. As you read this, imagine me as an archeologist uncovering an artifact which reveals that the society that they are studying is not what they imagined. I have a duty to report it even if I'd prefer it's not the case.

# Unfortunate background truths

We need to start by accepting certain things that are deeply unfortunate but outside of our power as a labor movement to immediately change.

1.  **People like talking to chatbots**. I wish it weren't true, but it is.
    
2.  **Conversations with chatbots will be major way that the formation of people's political opinions happens going forward**. This obviously sucks.
    
3.  **The workers you are organizing are talking to chatbots.**
    
4.  **When a worker wants help talking to their co-worker, they might ask ChatGPT because they ask ChatGPT everything.**
    
5.  **Workers you are organizing might be more interested in talking to a chatbot than you.**
    

There is every reason in the world to wish that these things weren't true and there is every reason to **_organize to make them less true_**, but there is **_no benefit to pretending that they are not currently true at this moment_**, and becoming more true every day.
