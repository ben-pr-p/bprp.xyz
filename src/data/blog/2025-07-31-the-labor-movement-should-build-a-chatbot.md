Preface:

> Before articulating what should be built and why, I just want to explain that I also agree with you that this is dumb, and like you, I also hate it.
> 
> That being said, we live in a world of unfortunate truths. As you read this, imagine me as an archeologist uncovering an artifact which reveals that the society that they are studying is not what they imagined.
