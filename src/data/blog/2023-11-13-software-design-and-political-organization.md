Below are the slides for a talk and discussion I lead at Newspeak House in London on November 12th, 2023.

Please feel free to contact me about anything here or if you'd like me to give this again somewhere else.

It's an Excalidraw whiteboard - depending on your screen size, it might look a bit funny.

Here is the presentation you can click through (give it a second to load):

And here is the Excalidraw embedded that you can scroll through if certain things are too small in the presentation.
