## **1 – I'm a good listener.**

By this, I do not mean that I make you feel heard or am good to vent with. In fact, as many people in my personal life will attest, venting with me is often unsatisfying and fails to deliver the catharsis one may find with a different peer.

When I say I'm a good listener, I mean that I am good at taking what people say and putting it into a cohesive understanding in my own head of what and how they think.

This makes me good at resolving misunderstandings and disagreements, which are usually actually misunderstandings even if not experienced that way by the participants. Even if some disagreement remains after the misunderstanding is clarified, it's still good to have it clarified. A clear disagreement, where people agree exactly what they disagree about, is generative. Anything other than that is frustrating.

If I inspect this skill a bit, I think the key is to try to defer how you resolve a speaker's references until you've gotten enough information through more examples that your resolution is right.

## **2 – I'm good at achieving alignment.**

I think this flows naturally from being a good listener. I often find myself in un-aligned or under-aligned environments – people at work saying they have no idea what's going on, don't know why things are happening, etc. People in political spaces who think they agree but can't actually come to a decision.

I think I'd define alignment via some test: two people are aligned on some idea _X_ (_X_ could be a technical approach, a political ideology, a business plan) if they both provide some answer _A_ to some question _Q_ if _A_ necessarily flows from _X_.

If I were are aligned on what to eat for dinner, specifically the idea that we are both want spicy food, and then I suggest a Szechuan restaurant and you suggest a burger place that has has hot sauce at the table, I'd say we are not aligned on what _spicy food_ means.

In my experience, I think _the number one reason that teams of people are not aligned is that the manager of a team doesn't care to achieve it_. The reason a manager should want their team to be aligned is that it makes the subsequent communication of work easier. Knowing that we are aligned on some important _X_ means that I can count on the fact that you will make all or most of the same inferences from _X_ that I would. It means that anytime I would have to say 3 things, if 2 of them are covered by _X_ I could just say 1.

I think a manager of a team does not care to achieve it if either _a)_ they do not have confidence that their team is capable of understanding _X_, or _b)_ they do not have confidence in their own ability to communicate _X_, or _c)_ they do not understand _X_ themselves - maybe the real _X_ that governs things is further up in the chain.

I think _the number two reason teams of people are not aligned is that the manager can't listen well enough to perceive it's absence,_ or misperceives an absence of alignment as individual dullness in each team member. This is where listening comes in: you have to be able to hear someone say something wrong and construct a theory of why they said that in terms of some deficiency of understanding of _X_. This will be hard for you if you do not have a broad understanding of all of the different perspectives of _X_ yourself. You can't resolve a conceptual reference they are making to an idea you haven't heard of.

I think _the number three reason is that the manager can't test its coherence_. Ideally, you reach alignment and then you test it on the spot.

## **3 – I'm not afraid of difficult solutions.**
