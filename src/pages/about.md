My name is Ben Packer and I am a Brooklyn based software engineer and socialist passionate about the upcoming PostgreSQL release and surviving the 21st century.

In 2019, I was a co-founder of \[\[Things I've Tried|Rewired Coop\]\], a technology coop building software for organizers with roots in the Bernie 2020 campaign and the Democratic Socialist left.

In 2024, I began my current role working on the technology for communications and organizing systems for the United Auto Workers.

## Contact

You can email me at [ben.paul.ryan.packer@gmail.com](mailto:ben.paul.ryan.packer@gmail.com). I am not important, famous, or terribly busy, and I do a good job at unsubscribing to things, so receiving an email is quite exciting!

You _should_ email me if:

*   <TODO>
    
*   You want to go to a Ninja Gym in Brooklyn and play around in the ball pits and stuff.
    
*   You would like to co-organize a group industrial tourism trip. We can visit all the types of power plants, mines, small & large farms/fisheries, water and waste treatment, recycling & trash, data centers, ports, logging, etc. It would be a lot of planning but I think a good time!
    
*   You are about to enter the labor market as a software engineer and want to ask what else I might know that you could do other than traditional tech roles.
    

## Billie

I have a lab/pitt+ mutt named Billie. I usually am not too interested in photos of other people's dogs, but you can find photos of her <TODO>
