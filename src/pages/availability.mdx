</Alert>

I have significant experience in production with high-write and high-read Postgres, and can quickly debug slow queries and give good advice on schema design and architecture. I enjoy writing Elixir and Typescript the most.

I have also recently done exploration and development with DuckDB, Delta Lake, and the larger Arrow ecosystem.

</Alert>

I have a good understanding of the way an organizing project data systems can support or hinder growth and accomplish goals, familiarity with most tools in the space, and can balance toil with complexity and maintainability. This isn't a paid thing!
